alerts.add
This command is used to configure the ZebraNet Alert System. It allows Zebra software to add new alerts
without having to use the ZPL ^SX command. This allows software to configure printers which do not have
ZPL on them, and it provides the software with a single way in for configuring alerts. It also allows the
software to configure alerts via local ports such as USB and serial.
The format is similar to the ^SX command. It can delete the alert when both the set and clear flags are set
to FALSE.
Setvar
This command instructs the printer to add the new alert with the configuration specified in the comma
delimited list.
To configure the ZebraNet Alert system:
! U1 setvar "alerts.add" "[condition],[destination],[set],
[clear],[destination_address],[port],[quelling],[SGD_name]"
Parameters
• The alert condition. This can be any of the values returned from alerts.conditions on page 569.
• The alert destination type. This can be any of the value returned from alerts.destinations on page 571.
• On Set - Set to Y if the alert should be sent when the event is set
• On Clear - Set to Y if the alert should be sent when the event is cleared
• Destination address - applies to TCP,UDP,EMAIL,SNMP, SDK, and HTTP POST destination types.
The maximum length of this address is 255 characters.
• Port - Applies to TCP and UDP types
• Quelling - When set to "Y" it prevents the alert from being sent. "N" is the default.
SGD Name - the name of the SGD command to be added. This is valid only when the alert condition is
SGD_SET.
Values
Defined via alerts.conditions on page 569: PAPER OUT, RIBBON OUT, HEAD TOO HOT, HEAD COLD,
HEAD OPEN, SUPPLY TOO HOT, RIBBON IN, REWIND, CUTTER JAM, MED, PRINTER PAUSED, PQ

alerts.http.authentication.add
This command allows the user to add a single server/username/password triplet into the list of
authentication entries.
When the printer attempts to connect to the URL in the HTTP POST alert, the server may require HTTP
authentication (such as digest, basic, DNS, etc.). There may be multiple authentication requests along the
route to the destination (for example, a local server first requires HTTP authentication as well as on the
remote server). For each HTTP authentication request received while attempting to connect, the printer will
enumerate the authentication entries and attempt to satisfy the request with the username/password pair
provided for the respective server. The server name in the entry is what determines which
username/password pair should be used for which authentication request. Both DNS names and IP
addresses are acceptable.
The server, username, and password are separated by a single space (not a tab or other white space
character). The server name is the only required field. If no username is supplied, but a password is, there
must be two spaces between the server and the password fields. If there is a username but no password,
or simply just the servername, no space is required at the end of the entry.
Setvar
To add server/username/password triplet into the list of authentication entries:
! U1 setvar "alerts.http.authentication.add" "servername[ username][ password]"
Values
Maximum string of 2048 characters.
Default
NA
Do
This command has the same settings as the setvar.
To add server/username/password triplet into the list of authentication entries:

This command allows the user to remove a single server/username/password triplet from the list of
authentication entries. To remove an entry, only the server name is supplied, and the entire entry will be
removed. If an invalid entry is supplied no action is taken.
Note that the list of authentication triplets will be updated (and saved over a reset) but this SGD is just a
command and doesn't have state. Therefore the persistent and restore defaults do not apply. The internal
list that this command removes from, however, is persistent and defaultable (defaults to an empty list).

capture.channel1.max_length
This command sets a length indicating when to copy captured data to the data SGD if the delimiter has not
been seen yet.
If the delimiter and the max_length are reached at the same time, the delimiter will not be part of the
captured data. Of only part of the delimiter has been received, then the part of the delimiter we have
received, will be part of the capture data.
When the max_length is changed, any data currently in the buffer will be thrown away, and the new value
of max_length will be used.
The Capture Port shall be defaulted to 1000 bytes by any mechanism (including ^JUF, ^JUN, ^JUA, and
device.restore_defaults).
Setvar
To instruct the printer to set a default data capture length:
! U1 setvar "capture.channel1.max_length" "value"
Values
1-3000
Default
"1000"
Getvar
To retrieve the default data capture length:
! U1 getvar "capture.channel1.max_length"

SGD Printer Commands
601
capture.channel1.port
This command determines the port that should be monitored for user data. This allows the user to attach
an external device, such as a keyboard or barcode scanner, and have input captured into the
capture.channel1.data.raw command. Once the data is in the SGD they can use it as they would any
other SGD (this includes functionality that allows users to be sent an alert when an SGD value changes).
The data received on the specified port will be read until the value in capture.channel1.delimiter is
seen, at which point the data received until (but not including) the delimiter will be stored in
capture.channel1.data.raw.
For the port specified in capture.channel1.port, no data will be sent to any of the parsers on that port. All
data received is assumed to be user input that is to be placed in capture.channel1.data.raw. To disable
the data capture functionality, set capture.channel1.port to "off"
The delimiter will not be stored in capture.channel1.data.raw.
The port will be shown in the data capture portion of the HZA response.
The capture port shall be defaulted to “off” by any mechanism (including ^JUF, ^JUA, and
device.restore_defaults).
Setvar
To set the port to be monitored for user data:
! U1 setvar "capture.channel1.port" "value"
Values
• off = no data is stored in capture.channel1.data.raw and all data is sent to the parsers - normal
operation
• serial = Data is read off the serial port. No data sent to the parsers on this port.
• usb = Data is read off the usb port. No data sent to the parsers on this port.
• bt= Data is read off the Bluetooth® port. No data sent to the parsers on this port.
• usb_host =not yet supported. reserved for when usb host is implemented.
Default
"off"
Getvar
To retrieve the printer’s current port being monitored for user data:
! U1 getvar "capture.channel1.port"
Example
This example sets the command value to "off", preventing it from capturing data.
! U1 setvar "capture.channel1.port" "off"

The CISDFCRC16 command downloads supported files types to the printer.
NOTE: When using certificate files, your printer supports:
a. Using Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) formatted certificate files.
b. Using the client certificate and private key as two files, each downloaded separately.
Using exportable PAC files for EAP-FAST.
IMPORTANT: When using certificate files, the time on the printer must be set correctly for the websocket
connection to succeed, as the time is used in the certificate validation.
Each line should be terminated with a CR/LF.
Type
! CISDFCRC16
<crc>
<filename>
<size>
<checksum>
<data>
NOTE: This command can be used in place of the ~DG and ~DY command for more saving and loading
options. ~DY is the preferred command to download TrueType fonts on printers with firmware later than
X.13. The CISDFCRC16 command also supports downloading wireless certificate files
Parameters Details
• <crc> = CRC value Values: a four digit CRC value in hexadecimal. If 0000 is entered, then the CRC
validation is ignored. For examples, see below.
• <filename> = file
name
Values: file name that is stored on the printer’s file system. An extension must be
specified. Files must be saved to the E: drive.
• <size> = file size Values: an eight digit file size specified in hexadecimal which indicates the number
of bytes in the <data> section.
• <checksum> =
checksum value
Values: a four digit checksum value in hexadecimal. If 0000 is entered, then the
CRC validation is ignored. The checksum value is calculated using the sum of the
bytes in the <data> section. For examples, see below.
• <data> = data Values: Binary data saved on the printer’s file system as <filename>. Number of
bytes in this field must match the <size> parameter.

These are examples of CRC and checksum values:
CRC example
The value of the <crc> field is calculated the CRC-16 for the contents of a specified file
using the CRC16-CCITT polynomial which is x^16 + x^12 + x^5 + 1. It is calculated using an
initial CRC of 0x0000.
checksum example
Given 4 bytes of data : 0x25, 0x62, 0x3F, 0x52:
1. Adding all bytes together gives 0x118.
2. Drop the carry nibble to get 0x18.
3. Get the two's complement of the 0x18 to get 0xE8.
This is the checksum byte.

This getvar example shows the response when value was set to "all"
! U1 getvar "device.epl_legacy_mode"
"all"
NOTES:
• This setting is not defaulted as part of a factory default (^JUF or ^default). The setting is persistent
across a power cycle or rest (~JR or device.reset).
• When setting the “registration” mode, the "print_orienation" mode is not changed. Likewise, when
setting the "print_orienation" mode, the "registration" mode is not changed. Using "off" or
"all" changes all modes.
Print Orientation Mode
NOTE: When the printer is powered on, the print orientation defaults to ^PON (EPL ZB mode). The print
orientation setting is not saved across power cycles. This is different than TLP2844, LP2844, TLP2824,
LP2824, and TLP3842 printers. Those printers have a default of ZB (ZPL ^PON mode) and the print
orientation setting is saved across power cycles. To make the printer have the print orientation behavior of
the TLP2844, LP2844, TLP2824, LP2824, and TLP3842 printers, set the epl_legacy_mode to
"print_orienation".
Registration Mode
NOTE: When printing labels using EPL commands, printing starts 1mm from the top edge of the label
(from the gap). This is known as the “no print zone”. When printing in ZT mode, the “no print zone” starts
at the gap on the leading edge of the label. When printing in ZB mode, the “no print zone” starts from the
gap on the trailing edge of the label. In the TLP2844, LP2844, TLP2824, LP2824, and TLP3842 printers,
the distance from gap to start of print (the “no print zone”) is not always 1mm.
The table below shows the nominal distance.
Distance from Edge of Label to First Print Line (No Print Zone)
Legacy Printer
Model New Printer Model ZT Mode ZB Mode
LP2844 GX420, GK420 (direct thermal) 1.9 mm 0.0 mm
TLP2844 GX420, GK420 (thermal transfer) 0.4 mm 1.6 mm

LP2824 LP 2824 Plus (direct thermal) 1.5 mm 0.4 mm
TLP2824 TLP 2824 Plus (thermal transfer) 0.1 mm 1.8 mm
a. Setting epl_legacy_mode to "registration" selects the distance shown in the table.
b. Setting epl_legacy_mode to "off" selects a no print zone distance of 1mm.

device.host_status
When this command is sent to the printer, the printer sends three data strings back. To avoid confusion,
the host prints each string on a separate line.
This command is similar to the ~HS ZPL command.
The response for this SGD command does not include the STX at the beginning of each data line and does
not include the ETX at the end of each data line as found in the ~HS response. Additionally, the first and
second response lines for the SGD command contain a CR/LF at the end of each line.
NOTE: When the command is sent, the printer will not send a response to the host if the printer is in one of
these conditions:
a. MEDIA OUT
b. RIBBON OUT
c. HEAD OPEN
d. REWINDER FULL
e. HEAD OVER-TEMPERATURE
Getvar
To return the current setting value:
! U1 getvar "device.host_status"

aaa = communication (interface) settings a
b = paper out flag (1 = paper out)
c = pause flag (1 = pause active)
dddd = label length (value in number of dots)
eee = number of formats in receive buffer
f = buffer full flag (1 = receive buffer full)
g = communications diagnostic mode flag
(1 = diagnostic mode active)
h = partial format flag (1 = partial format in progress)
c. This string specifies the printer’s baud rate, number of data bits, number of stop bits, parity setting, and type of
handshaking. This value is a three-digit decimal representation of an eight-bit binary number. To evaluate this parameter,
first convert the decimal number to a binary number.

device.user_vars.create
This command creates a user variable with the specified name, type, range, and default value. The root
SGD location for user variables is "device.user_vars".
Setvar
To instruct the printer to create a user variable with the specified parameters:
! U1 setvar "device.user_vars.create" "name:type:range:defaultValue"
Values
• name = the name of the SGD to appear in device.user_vars. The name can be anything from 1 to 64
printable ASCII characters. Any '.' within the name will be replaced with '_'. (e.g. "john.doe" will be
changed to "john_doe”. The name must be unique in the device.user_vars branch or it will not be
created. The name will be converted to lower case.
• type = one of STRING, INTEGER, DOUBLE, CHOICES, UPDOWNCHOICES, UPDOWNINTEGER,
UPDOWNDOUBLE. The type must be one of these types or the variable will not be created.
• STRING - For strings the range indicates the min/max length of the data that can be stored. If the
range is left blank, the default range is a string length of 0-1024. There is no maximum string length,
however, if large data is placed into the variables the user should be aware that system memory and
performance will be affected. Strings larger than available system memory will not be stored. Values
should attempt to stay around, or below, 5K.
• INTEGER/UPDOWNINTEGER - For integers the range can be any number expressed by a 32-bit
integer, signed or unsigned. If the range is left blank then a range of -32768 to 32767 will be used.
• DOUBLE/UPDOWNDOUBLE - A double can be any value within the range of +/–1.7e308. If the
range is left blank then a range of -32768.0 to 32767.0 will be used.
• CHOICES/UPDOWNCHOICES - Choices must be specified in a comma delimited list. The range
cannot be blank if the type is CHOICES or UPDOWNCHOICES.
• range = Expressed as x-y. The range of a variable depends upon the type. Some types will create
default ranges, while others will fail to be created if the range is invalid or not specified.
• default = the default value for the variable. The value must fall within the range specified or the
variable will not be created. If the type is INTEGER, UPDOWNINTEGER, DOUBLE,
UPDOWNDOUBLE the default value will be 0 if not specified. For STRING the default value will be an
empty string if it is not specified. CHOICES and UPDOWNCHOICES must have a default value and it
must be one of the choices within the specified range.
All four parts of the creation string must be present (some can be empty) meaning that there must be
three delimiter characters (':') present. There is no error shown or indicated otherwise when the variable
is not created for some reason. If the variable is not created one of the rules listed above has been
violated.
Any user variables will be deleted from the device.user_vars branch on a power cycle (they won't be
recreated on the next power up).
Defaulting the user_vars branch will restore the consumers back to their defaulted values and will not
remove them from the user_vars branch.
Example
To create a user variable named userVar1 that is an integer with a minimum of 1, a maximum of 10, and a
default/initial value of 5, issue this command:
SGD Printer Commands
727
! U1 setvar "device.user_vars.create" "userVar1:INTEGER:1-10:5"

SGD Printer Commands
769
input.capture
This parameter allows capturing input data in diagnostics mode. Input capture has three modes: "print",
"run", and "off". The "print" and "run" modes can be used to examine data received by the printer.
When in "print" mode the printer will save incoming data to files named "in???.dmp", where ??? is a
number between 001 to 999. The printer will then print the text and hexadecimal representation of data
bytes received instead of printing the formatted labels which that data might represent. When in "run"
mode the printer will save captured incoming data to files as above, but will otherwise run the incoming
data/commands normally.
The capture files should be deleted from printer memory after retrieving them. Leaving the printer in
"print" or "run" mode and not deleting the capture files will reduce the printer’s available flash memory.
The "off" mode is the printer’s normal operating mode. Cycling power will also return the printer to "off"
mode.
NOTE: This command does not capture a network packet trace.
Setvar
To set the directory name from which to retrieve files:
! U1 setvar "input.capture" "value"
Values
"print"
"run"
"off"
Getvar
To retrieve the current input.capture setting value:

SGD Printer Commands
1042
zpl.label_length
This command defines the length of the label. This command is necessary when using continuous media
(media that is not divided into separate labels by gaps, spaces, notches, slots, or holes).
This command is equivalent to the ^LL command.
Setvar
To set the label length:
! U1 setvar "zpl.label_length" "value"
Values
1 to 32000, (in dots) not to exceed the maximum label length.
While the printer accepts any value for this parameter, the amount of memory installed determines the
maximum length of the label.
Getvar
To return the current label length setting:
! U1 getvar "zpl.label_length"
Comments
These formulas can be used to determine the value of y:
Values for y depend on the memory size. If the entered value for y exceeds the acceptable limits, the
bottom of the label is cut off. The label also shifts down from top to bottom.
Example
! U1 setvar zpl.label_length" "1281"
NOTES:
• For printer support, see SGD Command Support on page 1455.
• For details on SGD command structure, see Command Structure on page 562.
For 6 dot/mm printheads... Label length in inches x 152.4 (dots/inch) = y
For 8 dot/mm printheads... Label length in inches x 203.2 (dots/inch) = y
For 12 dot/mm printheads... Label length in inches x 304.8 (dots/inch) = y
For 24 dot/mm printheads... Label length in inches x 609.6 (dots/inch) = y
SGD Printer Commands
1043
zpl.left_position
This command sets the label’s left margin offset in dots.
Related Command: ^LS
Setvar
To set the label left margin offset in dots:
! U1 setvar "zpl.left_position" "value"
Values
"-9999 to 9999"
Default
"0"
Getvar
To retrieve the currently set left margin offset for the label:
! U1 getvar "zpl.left_position"
Example
! U1 setvar "zpl.left_position" "100"

SGD Wired Commands
This chapter provides a high-level overview of the wired Set / Get / Do (SGD) commands. For printer
support of these SGD commands, see SGD Command Support on page 1455.
IMPORTANT: These are important points to note when using ZPL and SGD commands:
• SGD commands are case-sensitive.
• ZPL and SGD commands should be sent to the printer as separate files.
• Certain settings can be controlled by both ZPL and SGD. Configuration changes made in ZPL can
affect configuration changes made in SGD.
• Changes made with one command type (ZPL or SGD) will affect the data returned to the host in
response to both ZPL and getvar commands. The command type (ZPL or SGD) that was sent last
determines the current setting.
• Some RF cards do not support all of the SGD commands.
IMPORTANT: These are important points to note when using a Zebra G-Series printer:
SGD commands are available in printers with the following firmware versions or later:
• V54
• V66
• V68
• V72
• V73
• V74
• V75
• V76
• V78
• V79
• V60.16.2Z or later
• V60.15.xZ or later
• V50.15.xZ or later
• V61.15.xZ or later
• V56.15.xZ or later
• V53.16.x or later
• V53.15.2Z or later
• R53.16.3Z or later
• R60.15.8Z or later
• R62.15.8Z or later
• R63.15.8Z or later
• R65.15.8Z or later
SGD Wired Commands
1053
• You can send instructions to the printer using multiple programming languages: EPL, ZPL, or SGD.
EPL and ZPL commands configure the printer, print labels, and get device status information. SGD
commands set and get configuration details. These three languages can be used without the need to
send the printer instructions to switch from one language to another.
• EPL, ZPL, and SGD commands must be sent to the printer as separate files. They cannot be used
together in one format, or set of commands. For example, if you send a series of SGD commands to the
printer and they are followed by a printable format, this needs to be done using separate files.
Overview
This section describes how and why to use the Set / Get / Do (SGD) commands. It also provides an
example of a typical command structure.
NOTE: SGD commands must be terminated by a carriage return or a space and line feed.
SGD commands are commands that allow you to configure all printers with firmware version V60.15.x,
V50.15.x, V61.15.x, V56.15.x, V53.15.xZ, or later. The printer performs the specified function immediately
after receiving the command. The commands are:
• setvar
• getvar
• do
setvar Command
Setvar commands:
• are used to configure printer settings to specific values by setting them in the printer
• must be terminated by a space character or a CR/ LF (0x0D, 0x0A)
IMPORTANT: The setvar command and attributes must be specified in lower case.
getvar Command
Getvar commands:
• are used to get the current value of the printer settings
• must be terminated by a space character or CR/LF (0x0D, 0x0A)
The printer responds with the printer setting of “?” if:
• the printer setting does not exist (usually due to incorrect spelling of the printer setting)
• it has not been configured yet
IMPORTANT: The printer settings and attributes must be specified in lower case.
do Command
Do commands:
SGD Wired Commands
1054
• are used to instruct the printer to perform predefined actions
• must be terminated by a space character or a CR/LF (0x0D, 0x0A)
Some Do commands require additional settings which must be enclosed in double quotes.
IMPORTANT: The values must be specified in lower case.
Command Structure
It is important to understand the structure of the command and its components. A command structure
illustration is provided for each command in this guide.
This is an example of a command structure illustration:
This command must be terminated by a space character or a CR/ LF (0x0D, 0x0A).
How to Send Multiple SGD Commands
For any getvar, setvar, or do command, if you issue the syntax without the "1" and use the END
command followed by a space, multiple SGD commands are sent simultaneously.
This syntax shows how you can send multiple getvar commands:
1 Command—always preceded with an exclamation point (!) and must be
specified in lower case. A space resides between the !and U1 and between U1
and the command (setvar or getvar).
2 Attribute—always in double quotes and must be specified in lower case.
3 Chosen value—always in double quotes. Only applicable for setvar and do.
! U1 setvar "ip.addr" "value"
1 2 3
1 The command portion of the string does not use the "1" after the "! U".
2 Commands issued after the first command do not require the "! U".
3 The string of commands is terminated by the word "END" with a space after the
word, and by a carriage return/ line feed.
! U getvar "ip.telnet.enable"
getvar "ip.dhcp.enable"
getvar "ip.dhcp.cid_prefix"
END

SGD Wireless Commands
This chapter provides a high-level overview of the wireless Set / Get / Do (SGD) commands and details on
each SGD command. For printer support of these SGD commands, see SGD Command Support on
page 1455.
NOTE: The commands listed in this chapter are for use with the Wireless Print Server and Wireless Plus
Print Server, when used with firmware version V60.15.x, V50.15.x, or later.
IMPORTANT: These are important points to note when using ZPL and SGD commands:
• SGD commands are case-sensitive.
• ZPL and SGD commands should be sent to the printer as separate files.
• Certain settings can be controlled by both ZPL and SGD. Configuration changes made in ZPL can
affect configuration changes made in SGD.
• Changes made with one command type (ZPL or SGD) will affect the data returned to the host in
response to both ZPL and getvar commands. The command type (ZPL or SGD) that was sent last
determines the current setting.
• Some RF cards do not support all of the SGD commands.
IMPORTANT: These are important points to note when using a Zebra G-Series printer:
• You can send instructions to the printer using multiple programming languages: EPL, ZPL, or SGD.
EPL and ZPL commands configure the printer, print labels, and get device status information. SGD
commands set and get configuration details. These three languages can be used without the need to
send the printer instructions to switch from one language to another.
SGD commands are available in printers with the following firmware versions or later:
• V60.16.2Z or later
• V60.15.xZ or later
• V50.15.xZ or later
• V61.15.xZ or later
• V56.15.xZ or later
• V53.16.x or later
• V53.15.2Z or later
• R53.16.3Z or later

• EPL, ZPL, and SGD commands must be sent to the printer as separate files. They cannot be used
together in one format, or set of commands. For example, if you send a series of SGD commands to the
printer and they are followed by a printable format, this needs to be done using separate files.
Overview
This section describes how and why to use the Set / Get / Do (SGD) commands. It also provides an
example of a typical command structure.
NOTE: SGD commands must be terminated by a carriage return or a space and line feed.
SGD commands are commands that allow you to configure all printers with firmware version V60.15.x,
V50.15.x, V61.15.x, V56.15.x, V53.15.xZ, or later. The printer performs the specified function immediately
after receiving the command. The commands are:
• setvar
• getvar
• do
setvar Command
Setvar commands:
• are used to configure printer settings to specific values by setting them in the printer
• must be terminated by a space character or a CR/ LF (0x0D, 0x0A)
IMPORTANT: The setvar command and attributes must be specified in lower case.
getvar Command
Getvar commands:
• are used to get the current value of the printer settings
• must be terminated by a space character or CR/LF (0x0D, 0x0A)
The printer responds with the printer setting of “?” if:
• the printer setting does not exist (usually due to incorrect spelling of the printer setting)
• it has not been configured yet
IMPORTANT: The printer settings and attributes must be specified in lower case.
SGD Wireless Commands
1119
do Command
Do commands:
• are used to instruct the printer to perform predefined actions
• must be terminated by a space character or a CR/LF (0x0D, 0x0A)
Some Do commands require additional settings which must be enclosed in double quotes.
IMPORTANT: The values must be specified in lower case.
Command Structure
It is important to understand the structure of the command and its components. A command structure
illustration is provided for each command in this guide.
This is an example of a command structure illustration:
IMPORTANT: This command must be terminated by a space character or a CR/ LF (0x0D, 0x0A).
How to Send Multiple SGD Commands
For any getvar, setvar, or do command, if you issue the syntax without the "1" and use the END
command followed by a space, multiple SGD commands are sent simultaneously.
This syntax shows how you can send multiple getvar commands:
1 Command—always preceded with an exclamation point (!) and must be
specified in lower case. A space resides between the !and U1 and between U1
and the command (setvar or getvar).
2 Attribute—always in double quotes and must be specified in lower case.
3 Chosen value—always in double quotes. Only applicable for setvar and do.
! U1 setvar "ip.addr" "value"
1 2 3
1 The command portion of the string does not use the "1" after the "! U".
2 Commands issued after the first command do not require the "! U".
3 The string of commands is terminated by the word "END" with a space after the
word, and by a carriage return/ line feed.
! U getvar "ip.telnet.enable"
getvar "ip.dhcp.enable"
getvar "ip.dhcp.cid_prefix"
END

ip.dhcp.auto_provision_enable
This command prepares the printer to receive Weblink settings from the DHCP server. These settings are
used to allow the printer to connect to on-premise or web-based servers.
If DHCP receives option 43 in the format of "10642 <auto provision code> < auto provision
settings>” and the Client is not already configured, the client will use the configuration to connect to the
server.
Using this feature requires configuring your DHCP server to send option 43 information during address
assignment. The feature allows the printer to obtain the settings used to control Cloud Connect weblink
connections or Mirror events as part of receiving a DHCP assigned IP address. This requires that DHCP
option 60 is not empty and that ip.dhcp.auto_provision_enable is set to "on".
The package of Cloud Connect/weblink information sent from the DHCP server in the Option 43 response
can include the:
• Server address
• Authentication server name
• User name and password for proxy logins
The package of Mirror information sent from the DHCP server in the Option 43 packet can include the:
• Server address
• Mirror path
• Mirror feedback path
• Mirror appl path
• Mirror mode

weblink.ip.conn[1|2].authentication.add
This command allows the user to add a single server/username/password triplet into the list of
authentication entries.
When the printer attempts to connect to the server (url specified in weblink.ip.conn[1|2].location)
the server may require HTTP authentication (e.g. digest, basic, DNS, etc.). There may be multiple
authentication requests along the route to the destination (e.g. a locals erver first requires HTTP
authentication as well as on the remote server).
For each HTTP authentication request received while attempting to connect, the printer will enumerate the
authentication entries and attempt to satisfy the request with the username/password pair provided for the
respective server. The server name in the entry is what determines which username/password pair should
be used for which authentication request. Both DNS names and IP addresses are acceptable. The server,
username, and password are separated by a single space (not a tab or other white space character). The
server name is the only required field. If no username is supplied, but a password is, there must be two
spaces between the server and the password fields. If there is a username but no password, or simply just
the servername, no space is required at the end of the entry.
If the command is changed when the connection is enabled (weblink.enable is set to "on"), it will
not take effect until the connection is disabled, and then re-enabled.
NOTE: This setting only be changed when weblink.enable is set to "off".
^JUF, ^JUS, ^JUN, ^JUA, and device.restore_defaults do not have any affect on this setting.
Setvar
To add a single server/username/password triplet to the list of authentication entries:

weblink.ip.conn[1|2].test.location
This command holds the URL for testing a connection to the internet. This is meant to assist users in
debugging their printer's connection to remote servers when there are issues with the main weblink
connection (conn1 or conn2).
The URL must follow the URL rules for the HTTP[S] protocol outlined in RFC2396
(http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt).
^JUF, ^JUS, ^JUN, ^JUA, and device.restore_defaults do not have any affect on this setting.
Setvar
To set the URL to hold for testing a connection:
! U1 setvar "weblink.ip.conn1.test.location" "url"
! U1 setvar "weblink.ip.conn2.test.location" "url"
Values
Any HTTPS URL up to 2048 characters
Default
"http://www.zebra.com/apps/linktest"
Getvar
To retrieve the printer's test connection URL:
! U1 getvar "weblink.ip.conn1.test.location"
! U1 getvar "weblink.ip.conn2.test.location"
Do
To set the URL to hold for testing a connection:
! U1 do "weblink.ip.conn1.test.location" "url"
! U1 do "weblink.ip.conn2.test.location" "url"
Values
Any HTTPS URL up to 2048 characters
Default
"http://www.zebra.com/apps/linktest"
Example
The test connection can assist the user in several ways/scenarios:
1. If the test.test_on value is set to "failure", any time the main weblink (conn[1|2].location)
connection fails to connect then the test.location URL will be used. In this situation, an attempt will
be made to contact the remote URL in test.location, using authentication and proxy configuration
that is specified by the main connection.
SGD Wireless Commands
1250
2. If the test.test_on value is set to "interval" an attempt will be made to contact the remote URL in
test.location every test.retry_interval seconds, using authentication and proxy configuration
that is specified by the main connection.
3. If the test.test_on value is set to "both", then scenario 1 and 2 will both occur. This is useful for
users who will use an HTTP connection to move through their firewall - and thereafter frequently refresh
the connection to indicate to their firewall that there is still activity for the purpose of keeping the
connection alive.

weblink.zebra_connector.authentication.add
This command allows the user to add a single server/username/password triplet into the list of
authentication entries.
When the printer attempts to connect to the Zebra Printer Connector, the local server may require HTTP
authentication (e.g. digest, basic, DNS, etc.). There may be multiple authentication requests along the
route to the destination (e.g. a local server first requires HTTP authentication as well as on the remote
server).
For each HTTP authentication request received while attempting to connect, the printer will enumerate the
authentication entries and attempt to satisfy the request with the username/password pair provided for the
respective server. The server name in the entry is what determines which username/password pair should
be used for which authentication request. Both DNS names and IP addresses are acceptable. The server,
username, and password are separated by a single space (not a tab or other white space character). The
server name is the only required field. If no username is supplied, but a password is, there must be two
spaces between the server and the password fields. If there is a username but no password, or simply just
the servername, no space is required at the end of the entry.
If the command is changed while the Visibility Agent is enabled, it will not take effect until the connection is
disabled, and then re-enabled.
IMPORTANT: This setting can only be changed when weblink.zebra_connector.enable is set to "off".
^JUF, ^JUS, ^JUN, ^JUA, and device.restore_defaults do not have any affect on this setting.
Setvar
To allow the user to add a single server/username/password triplet into the list of authentication entries:
! U1 setvar "weblink.zebra_connector.authentication.add" "server username password"
